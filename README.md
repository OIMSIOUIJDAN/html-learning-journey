## 🌱 Lesson 1: My First HTML Page

In this lesson, I created my first HTML page directly in GitHub.

### What I Learned
- **<!DOCTYPE html>** declares this is an HTML5 page.
- **<html>** is the root element of the page.
- **<head>** contains metadata, like title and character encoding.
- **<title>** sets the browser tab title.
- **<body>** contains the visible content.
- **<h1>** is a main heading.
- **<p>** is a paragraph.
