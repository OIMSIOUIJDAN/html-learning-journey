## 🌱 Lesson 1: My First HTML Page

In this lesson, I created my first HTML page directly in GitHub.

### What I Learned
- **<!DOCTYPE html>** declares this is an HTML5 page.
- **<html>** is the root element of the page.
- **<head>** contains metadata, like title and character encoding.
- **<title>** sets the browser tab title.
- **<body>** contains the visible content.
- **<h1>** is a main heading.
- **<p>** is a paragraph.

# 🌿 Lesson 2: Text Formatting, Lists, Links, and Images

In this lesson, I learned how to improve my HTML page by adding formatting, lists, links, and images.

## ✅ What I Learned
- `<b>` makes text bold  
- `<strong>` makes text bold and gives it importance (recommended)
- `<i>` makes text italic  
- `<em>` emphasizes text (recommended)
- `<u>` underlines text  
- `<mark>` highlights text  
- `<br>` creates a line break  
- `<hr>` creates a horizontal line  
- `<ul>` creates an unordered list (bullets)  
- `<ol>` creates an ordered list (numbers)  
- `<li>` defines a list item  
- `<a>` creates a link  
- `href` specifies the link URL  
- `target="_blank"` opens the link in a new tab  
- `<img>` displays an image  
- `src` is the image path or URL  
- `alt` describes the image if it fails to load
