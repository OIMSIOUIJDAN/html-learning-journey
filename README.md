## 🌱 Lesson 1: My First HTML Page

In this lesson, I created my first HTML page directly in GitHub.

### What I Learned
- **<!DOCTYPE html>** declares this is an HTML5 page.
- **<html>** is the root element of the page.
- **<head>** contains metadata, like title and character encoding.
- **<title>** sets the browser tab title.
- **<body>** contains the visible content.
- **<h1>** is a main heading.
- **<p>** is a paragraph.

### My First HTML Page
You can view the file [here](<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Lesson 1 - My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My HTML Learning Journey!</h1>
